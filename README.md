# Artificial Neural Network & Deep Learning

This repository contains the projects developed during the Artificial Neural Network & Deep Learning course (23/24) at Politecnico di Milano.

## Image Classification of Plant Leaves

One of the challenges tackled in this repository was to implement a neural network for image classification, specifically focusing on distinguishing between healthy and diseased plant leaves. The objective was to build a model capable of accurately categorizing images of plant leaves into two classes: healthy and unhealthy. The dataset consisted of images of plant leaves, with annotations indicating whether the leaf was healthy or diseased. 

## Time Series Forecasting

Another challenge addressed in this repository was time series forecasting using neural networks. The objective was to predict future values of a time series based on historical data.
